<p>THE GOD AND THE OPAL<br>
TO TH<font face="Times New Roman">É</font>OPHILE GAUTIER</p>

<p>Gray caught he from the cloud, and green from earth,<br>
And from a human breast the fire he drew,<br>
And life and death were blended in one dew.<br>
A sunbeam golden with the morning's mirth,<br>
A wan, salt phantom from the sea, a girth<br>
Of silver from the moon, shot colour through<br>
The soul invisible, until it grew<br>
To fulness, and the Opal Song had birth.</p>

<p>And then the god became the artisan.<br>
With rarest skill he made his gem to glow,<br>
Carving and shaping it to beauty such<br>
That down the cycles it shall gleam to man,<br>
And evermore man's wonderment shall know<br>
The perfect finish, the immortal touch.</p>

<p>Agnes Lee.</p><a name="2"></a><br>
<br>

<p>PREFACE</p>

<p>When empires lay riven apart,<br>
Fared Goethe at battle time's thunder<br>
To fragrant oases of art,<br>
To weave his <i>Divan</i> into wonder.</p>

<p>Leaving Shakespeare, he pondered the note<br>
Of Nisami, and heard in his leisure<br>
The hoopoe's weird monody float,<br>
And set it to soft Orient measure.</p>

<p>As Goethe at Weimar delayed<br>
And dreamed in the fair garden closes,<br>
And, questing in sun or in shade,<br>
With Hafiz plucked redolent roses,—</p>

<p>I, closed from the tempest that shook<br>
My window with fury impassioned,<br>
Sat dreaming, and, safe in my nook,<br>
Enamels and Cameos fashioned.<br></p><a name="3"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AFFINITY<br>
A PANTHEISTIC MADRIGAL</p>

<p>On an ancient temple gleaming,<br>
Two great blocks of marble high<br>
Thrice a thousand years lay dreaming<br>
Dreams against an Attic sky.</p>

<p>Set within one silver whiteness,<br>
Two wave-tears for Venus shed,<br>
Two fair pearls of orient brightness,<br>
Through the waste of water sped.</p>

<p>In the Generalife's fresh closes,<br>
By a Moorish light illumed,<br>
Two delicious, tender roses<br>
By a fountain met and bloomed.</p>

<p>In the balm of May's bright weather,<br>
Where the domes of Venice rise,<br>
Lighted on Love's nest together<br>
Two pale doves from azure skies.</p>

<p>All things vanish into wonder,<br>
Marble, pearl, dove, rose on tree,<br>
Pearl shall melt and marble sunder,<br>
Flower shall fade and bird shall flee!</p>

<p>Not a smallest part but lowly<br>
Through the crucible must pass,<br>
Where all shapes are molten slowly<br>
In the universal mass.</p>

<p>Then as gradual Time discloses<br>
Marbles melt to whitest skin,<br>
Roses red to lips of roses,<br>
And anew the lives begin.</p>

<p>And again the doves are plighted<br>
In the hearts of lovers, while<br>
Ocean pearls are reunited,<br>
Set within a coral smile.</p>

<p>Thus affinity comes welling;<br>
By its beauty everywhere<br>
Soul a sister-soul foretelling,<br>
All awakened and aware.</p>

<p>Quickened by a zephyr sunny,<br>
Or a perfume, subtlewise,<br>
As the bee unto the honey,<br>
Atom unto atom flies.</p>

<p>And remembered are the hours<br>
In the temple, down the blue,<br>
And the talks amid the flowers,<br>
Near the fount of crystal dew,</p>

<p>Kisses warm, and on the royal<br>
Golden domes the wings that beat;<br>
For the atoms all are loyal,<br>
And again must love and greet.</p>

<p>Love forgotten wakes imperious,<br>
For the past is never dead,<br>
And the rose with joy delirious<br>
Breathes again from lips of red.</p>

<p>Marble on the flesh of maiden<br>
Feels its own white bloom, and faint<br>
Knows the dove a murmur laden<br>
With the echo of its plaint,</p>

<p>Till resistance giveth over,<br>
And the barriers fall undone,<br>
And the stranger is the lover,<br>
And affinity hath won!</p>

<p>You before whose face I tremble,<br>
Say—what past we know not of<br>
Called our fates to reassemble,—<br>
Pearl or marble, rose or dove?</p><a name="4"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE POEM OF WOMAN<br>
MARBLE OF PAROS</p>

<p>Unto the dreamer once whose heart she had,<br>
As she was showing forth her treasures rare,<br>
Minded she was to read a poem fair,<br>
The poem of her form with beauty glad.</p>

<p>First stately and superb she swept before<br>
His gazing eyes, with high, Infanta mien,<br>
Trailing behind her all the splendid sheen<br>
Of nacarat floods of velvet that she wore.</p>

<p>Thus at the opera had he watched her bend<br>
From out her box, her body one bright flame,<br>
When all the air was ringing with her name,<br>
And every song made her fair praise ascend.</p>

<p>Then had her art another way, for look!<br>
The weighty velvet dropped, and in its place<br>
A pale and cloudy fabric proved the grace<br>
Of every line her glowing body took;</p>

<p>Till softly from her shoulder marble-sweet<br>
The veil diaphanous fell, the folds whereof<br>
Came fluttering downward like a snowy dove,<br>
To nestle in the wonder of her feet.</p>

<p>She posed as for Apelles pridefully,<br>
A lovely flesh and marble womanhood:—<br>
Anadyomene, she upright stood<br>
Naked upon the margent of the sea.</p>

<p>Fairer than any foam-drops crystalline,<br>
Great pearls of Venice lay upon her breast,<br>
Jewels of milky wonder lightly pressed<br>
Upon the cool, fresh satin of her skin.</p>

<p>Exhaustless as the waves that kiss the brim,<br>
Under the gleaming moon of many moods,<br>
Were all the strophes of her attitudes.<br>
What fascination sang her beauty's hymn!</p>

<p>But soon, grown weary of an art antique,<br>
Of Phidias and of Venus, lo! again<br>
Within another new and plastic strain<br>
She grouped her charms unveiled and unique.</p>

<p>Upon a cashmere opulently spread,<br>
Sultana of Seraglio then she lay,<br>
Laughing unto her little mirror gay,<br>
That laughed again with lips of coral red;</p>

<p>The indolent, soft Georgian, posturing<br>
With her long, supple narghile at lip,<br>
Showing the glorious fashion of her hip,<br>
One foot upon the other languishing.</p>

<p>And, like to Ingres' Odalisque, supine,<br>
Defying prurient modesty turned she,<br>
Displaying in her beauty candidly<br>
Wonder of curve and purity of line.</p>

<p>But hence, thou idle Odalisque! for life<br>
Hath now its own fair picture to display—<br>
The diamond in its rare effulgent ray,—<br>
Beauty in Love hath reached its blossom rife.</p>

<p>She sways her body, bendeth back her head.<br>
Her breathing comes more subtle and more fast.<br>
Rocked in her dream's alluring arms, at last<br>
Down hath she fallen upon her costly bed.</p>

<p>Her eyelids beat like fluttering pinions lit<br>
Upon the darkened silver of her eyes.<br>
Her bright, voluptuous glances upward rise<br>
Into the vague and nacreous infinite.</p>

<p>Deck her with sweet, lush violets, instead<br>
Of death-flowers with their every pearl a tear;<br>
Scatter their purple clusters on her bier,<br>
Who of her being's ecstasy lies dead.</p>

<p>And bear her very gently to her tomb—<br>
Her bed of white. There let the poet stay,<br>
Long hours upon his bended knees to pray,<br>
When night shall close around the funeral room.</p><a name="5"></a><br>
<br>

<p>A STUDY OF HANDS</p><a name="6"></a>


<p>I</p>

<p>IMPERIA</p>

<p>A sculptor showed to me one day<br>
A hand, a Cleopatra's lure,<br>
Or an Aspasia's, cast in clay,<br>
Of masterwork a fragment pure.</p>

<p>Seized in a snowy kiss, and fair<br>
As lily in the argent rise<br>
Of dawn, like whitest poem there<br>
Its beauty lay before mine eyes,</p>

<p>Bright in its pallor lustreless,<br>
Reposing on a velvet bed,<br>
Its fingers, weighted with their dress<br>
Of jewels, delicately spread.</p>

<p>A little parted lay the thumb,<br>
Showing the undulating line,<br>
Beautiful, graceful, subtlesome,<br>
Of its proud contour Florentine.</p>

<p>Strange hand! I wonder if it toyed<br>
In silken locks of Don Juan,<br>
Or on a gem-bright caftan joyed<br>
To stroke the beard of some soldan;</p>

<p>Whether, as courtesan or queen,<br>
Within its fingers fair and slight<br>
Was pleasure's gilded sceptre seen,<br>
Or sceptre of a royal might!</p>

<p>But sweet and firm it must have lain<br>
Full oft its touch of power rare<br>
Upon the curling lion-mane<br>
Of some chimera caught in air.</p>

<p>Imperial, idle fantasy,<br>
And love of soft, luxurious things,<br>
Frenzies of passion, wondrous, free,<br>
Impossible dream-flutterings!</p>

<p>Romances wild, and poesy<br>
Of hasheech and of wine, vain speeds<br>
Beneath Bohemia's brilliant sky<br>
On unrestrained and maddened steeds!</p>

<p>All these were in the lines of it,<br>
Of that white book with magic scrolled,<br>
Where ciphers stood, by Venus writ,<br>
That Love had trembled to behold.</p><a name="7"></a><br>
<br>

<p>II</p>

<p>LACENAIRE</p>

<p>Strange contrast was the severed hand<br>
Of Lacenaire, the murderer dead,<br>
Soaked in a powerful essence, and<br>
Near by upon a cushion spread.</p>

<p>Letting a morbid fancy win,<br>
I touched, despite my loathing sane,<br>
The cold, hair-covered, slimy skin,<br>
Not yet washed clean of deathly stain.</p>

<p>Yellow, uncanny, mummified,<br>
Like to a Pharaoh's hand it lay,<br>
And stretched its faun-shaped fingers wide,<br>
Crisp with temptation's awful play;</p>

<p>As though an itch for flesh and gold<br>
Lured them to horrors yet to be,<br>
Twisting them roughly as of old,<br>
Teasing their immobility.</p>

<p>There every vice and passion's whim<br>
Had seamed the flesh abundantly<br>
With hideous hieroglyphs and grim,<br>
That headsmen read with fluency.</p>

<p>There plainly writ in furrows fell,<br>
I saw the deeds of sin and soil,<br>
Scorchings from every fiery hell<br>
Wherein corruptions seethe and boil.</p>

<p>There was a track of Capri's vice,<br>
Of lupanars and gaming-scores,<br>
Fretted with wine and blood and dice,<br>
Like ennui of old emperors.</p>

<p>Supple and fierce, it had some dower<br>
Of grace unto the searching eye,<br>
Some brutal fascination's power,<br>
A gladiator's mastery.</p>

<p>Cold aristocracy of crime!<br>
No plane inured, no hammer spent<br>
The hand whose task for every time<br>
Had but the knife for implement.</p>

<p>The hand of Lacenaire! No clue<br>
Therein to labour's honest pride!<br>
False poet, and assassin true,<br>
The Manfred of the gutter died!</p><a name="8"></a><br>
<br>

<p>VARIATIONS ON THE CARNIVAL OF VENICE</p><a name="9"></a>

<p>I</p>

<p>ON THE STREET</p>

<p>There is a popular old air<br>
That every fiddler loves to scrape.<br>
'T is wrung from organs everywhere,<br>
To barking dog with wrath agape.</p>

<p>The music-box has registered<br>
Its phrases garbled and reviled.<br>
'T is classic to the household bird;<br>
Grandmother learned it as a child.</p>

<p>The trumpet and the clarinet,<br>
In dusty gardens of the dance,<br>
Blow it to clerk and gay grisette,<br>
In shrill, unlovely resonance.</p>

<p>And of a Sunday swarm the folk<br>
Under the honeysuckle vine,<br>
Quaffing, the while they talk and smoke,<br>
The sun, the melody, the wine.</p>

<p>It lurks within the wry bassoon<br>
The blind man plays, the porch beneath.<br>
His poodle whimpers low the tune,<br>
And holds the cup between its teeth.</p>

<p>The players of the light guitar,<br>
Decked with their flimsy tartans, pale,<br>
With voices sad, where feasters are,<br>
Through coffee-houses fling its wail.</p>

<p>Great Paganini at a sign,<br>
One night, as with a needle's gleam,<br>
Picked up with end of bow divine<br>
The little antiquated theme,</p>

<p>And, threading it with fingers deft,<br>
He broidered it with colours bright,<br>
Till up and down the faded weft<br>
Ran golden arabesques of light.</p><a name="10"></a><br>
<br>

<p>II</p>

<p>ON THE LAGOONS</p>

<p>Tra la, tra la, la, la, la,—who<br>
Knows not the theme's soft spell?<br>
Or sad or light or mock or true,<br>
Our mothers loved it well.</p>

<p>The Carnival of Venice! Long<br>
Adown canals it came,<br>
Till, wafted on a zephyr's song,<br>
The ballet kept its fame.</p>

<p>I seem, whene'er its phrase I hear,<br>
A gondola to view,<br>
With prow voluted, black and clear,<br>
Slip o'er the water blue;</p>

<p>To see, her bosom covered o'er<br>
With pearls, her body suave,<br>
The Adriatic Venus soar<br>
On sound's chromatic wave.</p>

<p>The domes that on the water dwell<br>
Pursue the melody<br>
In clear-drawn cadences, and swell<br>
Like breasts of love that sigh.</p>

<p>My chains around a pillar cast,<br>
I land before a fair<br>
And rosy-pale facade at last,<br>
Upon a marble stair.</p>

<p>Oh! all dear Venice with her towers,<br>
Her boats, her masquers boon,<br>
Her sweet chagrins, her mad, gay hours,<br>
Throbs in that ancient tune.</p>

<p>The tenuous, vibrant chords that smite,<br>
Rebuild in subtle way<br>
The city joyous, free and light<br>
Of Canaletto's day!</p><a name="11"></a><br>
<br>

<p>III</p>

<p>CARNIVAL</p>

<p>Venice robes her for the ball;<br>
Decked with spangles bright,<br>
Multi-coloured Carnival<br>
Teems with laughter light.</p>

<p>Harlequin with negro mask,<br>
Tights of serpent hue,<br>
Beateth with a note fantasque<br>
His Cassander true.</p>

<p>Flapping loose his long, white sleeve,<br>
Like a penguin spread,<br>
Through a subtle semibreve<br>
Pierrot thrusts his head.</p>

<p>Sleek Bologna's doctor goes<br>
Maundering on a bass.<br>
Punchinello finds for nose<br>
Quaver on his face.</p>

<p>Hurtling Trivellino fine,<br>
On a trill intent,<br>
Scaramouch to Columbine<br>
Gives the fan she lent.</p>

<p>Gliding to the tune, I mark<br>
One veiled figure rise,<br>
While through satin lashes dark<br>
Luring gleam her eyes.</p>

<p>Tender little edge of lace,<br>
Heaving with her breath!<br>
&quot;Under is her own dear face!&quot;<br>
An arpeggio saith.</p>

<p>And beneath the mask I know<br>
Bloom of rosy lips,<br>
And the patch on chin of snow,<br>
As she by me trips!</p><a name="12"></a><br>

<p>IV</p>

<p>MOONLIGHT</p>

<p>Amid the chatter gay and mad<br>
Saint Mark to Lido wafts, a tune<br>
Like as a rocket riseth glad<br>
As fountain riseth to the moon.</p>

<p>But in that air with laughter stirred,<br>
That shakes its bells far out to sea,<br>
Regret, a little stifled bird,<br>
Mingles its frail sob audibly.</p>

<p>And in a mist of memory clad,<br>
Like dream well-nigh effaced, I view<br>
The sweet Beloved, fair and sad,<br>
Of dear, long-vanished days I knew.</p>

<p>Ah, pale she is! My soul in tears<br>
An April day remembers yet:—<br>
We sought the violets by the meres,<br>
And in the grass our fingers met. . .</p>

<p>The vibrant note of violin<br>
Is the child voice that struck my heart,<br>
Exquisite, plaintive, argentine,<br>
With all the anguish of its dart.</p>

<p>So sweetly, falsely, doth it steal,<br>
So cruel, yet so tender, too,<br>
So cold, so burning, that I feel<br>
A deadly pleasure pierce me through;</p>

<p>Until my heart, an archway deep<br>
Whose waters feed the fountain's lip,<br>
Lets tears of blood in silence weep<br>
Into my bosom drip by drip.</p>

<p>O Carnival of Venice!—theme<br>
So chilling sad, yet ever warm!<br>
Where laughter toucheth tears supreme,—<br>
How hast thou hurt me with thy charm!</p><a name="13"></a><br>

<p>SYMPHONY IN WHITE MAJOR</p>

<p>In the Northern tales of eld,<br>
From the Rhine's escarpments high<br>
Swan-women radiant were beheld,<br>
Singing and floating by,</p>

<p>Or, leaving their plumage bright<br>
On a bough that was bending low,<br>
Displaying skin more gleaming white<br>
Than the white of their down of snow.</p>

<p>At times one comes our way,—<br>
Of all she is pallidest,<br>
White as the moonbeam's shivering ray<br>
On a glacier's icy crest.</p>

<p>Her boreal bloom doth win<br>
Our eyes to feasting rare<br>
On rich delight of nacreous skin,<br>
And a wealth of whiteness fair.</p>

<p>Her rounded breasts, pale globes<br>
Of snow, wage insolent war<br>
With her camellias and her robes<br>
Of whiteness nebular.</p>

<p>In such white wars supreme<br>
She wins, and weft and flower<br>
Leave their revenge's right, and seem<br>
Yellowed with envy's hour.</p>

<p>On the white of her shoulder bare,<br>
Whose marble Paros lends,<br>
As through the Polar twilight fair,<br>
Invisible frost descends.</p>

<p>What beaming virgin snow,<br>
What pith a reed within,<br>
What Host, what taper, did bestow<br>
The white of her matchless skin?</p>

<p>Was she made of a milky drop<br>
On the blue of a winter heaven?<br>
The lily-blow on the stem's green top?<br>
The foam of the sea at even?</p>

<p>Of the marble still and cold,<br>
Wherein the great gods dwell?<br>
Of creamy opal gems that hold<br>
Faint fires of mystic spell?</p>

<p>Or the organ's ivory keys?<br>
Her wing<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d fingers oft<br>
Like butterflies flit over these,<br>
With kisses pending soft.</p>

<p>Of the ermine's stainless fold,<br>
Whose white, warm touches fall<br>
On shivering shoulders and on bold,<br>
Bright shields armorial?</p>

<p>Of the phantom flowers of frost<br>
Enscrolled on the window clear?<br>
Of the fountain drop in the chill air lost,<br>
An Undine's frozen tear?</p>

<p>Of May bent low with the sweets<br>
Of her bountiful white-thorn bloom?<br>
Of alabaster that repeats<br>
The pallor of grief and gloom?</p>

<p>Of the feathers of doves that slip<br>
And snow on the gable steep?<br>
Of slow stalactite's tear-white drip<br>
In cavernous places deep?</p>

<p>Came she from Greenland floes<br>
With Seraphita forth?<br>
Is she Madonna of the Snows?<br>
A sphinx of the icy North,</p>

<p>Sphinx buried by avalanche,<br>
The glacier's guardian ghost,<br>
Whose frozen secrets hide and blanch<br>
In her white heart innermost?</p>

<p>What magic of what far name<br>
Shall this pale soul ignite?<br>
Ah! who shall flush with rose's flame<br>
This cold, implacable white?</p><a name="14"></a><br>

<p>COQUETRY IN DEATH</p>

<p>I beg ye grant, when low I lie,<br>
Before ye close my coffin-bed,<br>
A little black beneath mine eye,<br>
And on my cheek a touch of red!</p>

<p>Ah, make me beautiful as now!<br>
For I would be upon my bier,<br>
As on the night of his avow<br>
Charming and bloomful, gay and dear.</p>

<p>For me no linen winding-sheet!<br>
But gown me very grand and bright.<br>
Bring forth my frock of muslin sweet,<br>
With many ruffles soft and white.</p>

<p>My favourite frock! I wore it well,<br>
Who wore it at love's flowering.<br>
And since his look upon it fell,<br>
I've kept it as a sacred thing.</p>

<p>For me no funeral coronet,<br>
No tear-embroidered cushion place;<br>
But o 'er my fair lace pillow let<br>
My hair droop free about my face.</p>

<p>Dear pillow! Often did it mark,<br>
In mad, sweet nights our brows unlit,<br>
And, all within the gondola dark,<br>
Did count our kisses infinite.</p>

<p>About my waxen hands supine,<br>
Folded in prayer at life's deep gloam,<br>
My rosary of opals twine,<br>
Blessed by His Holiness at Rome.</p>

<p>I'll finger it, when bedded cold<br>
Where never one shall rise. How oft<br>
His lips upon my lips have told<br>
A <i>Pater</i> and an <i>Ave</i> soft!</p><a name="15"></a><br>

<p>HEART'S DIAMOND</p>

<p>Every lover deep hath set<br>
In a sacred nook apart<br>
Some dear token for the heart<br>
In its hope or its regret.</p>

<p>One hath nested safe away<br>
Blackest ringlet ever seen,<br>
Over which an azure sheen<br>
Lieth, as on wing of jay.</p>

<p>One from shoulder pale as milk<br>
Took a tress more golden-fine<br>
Than the threads that softly shine<br>
In the silk-worm's wonder-silk.</p>

<p>In its hiding mystical,<br>
Memory's reliquary sweet,<br>
Glances of another greet<br>
Gloves with fingers white and small.</p>

<p>And another yet may list<br>
To inhale a faint perfume<br>
Of the violets from her room,<br>
Freshly given—faded, kissed.</p>

<p>Here a slipper's curving grace<br>
One with sighing treasureth.<br>
There another guards a breath<br>
In a mask's light edge of lace.</p>

<p>I've no slipper to revere,<br>
Neither glove nor tress nor flower;<br>
But I cherish for love's dower<br>
A divine, ador<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d tear,—</p>

<p>Fallen from the blue above,<br>
Clearest dew, heaven's drop for me,<br>
Pearl dissolved secretly<br>
In the chalice of my love.</p>

<p>To mine eyes the dim-worn dew<br>
Beams, a gem of Orient worth,<br>
Standing from the parchment forth,<br>
Diamond of a sapphire blue,—</p>

<p>Steadfast, lustreful and deep!<br>
Tear that fell unhoped, unsought,<br>
On a song my soul once wrought,<br>
From an eye unused to weep.</p><a name="16"></a><br>

<p>SPRING'S FIRST SMILE</p>

<p>While up and down the earth men pant and plod,<br>
March, laughing at the showers and days unsteady,<br>
And whispering secret orders to the sod,<br>
For Spring makes ready.</p>

<p>And slyly when the world is sleeping yet,<br>
He smooths out collars for the Easter daisies,<br>
And fashions golden buttercups to set<br>
In woodland mazes.</p>

<p>Coif-maker fine, he worketh well his plan.<br>
Orchard and vineyard for his touch are prouder.<br>
From a white swan he hath a down to fan<br>
The trees with powder.</p>

<p>While Nature still upon her couch doth lean,<br>
Stealthily hies he to the garden closes,<br>
And laces in their bodices of green<br>
Pale buds of roses.</p>

<p>Composing his solfeggios in the shade,<br>
He whistles them to blackbirds as he treadeth,<br>
And violets in the wood, and in the glade<br>
Snowdrops, he spreadeth.</p>

<p>Where for the restless stag the fountain wells,<br>
His hidden hand glides soft amid the cresses,<br>
And scatters lily-of-the-valley bells,<br>
In silver dresses.</p>

<p>He sinks the sweet, vermilion strawberries<br>
Deep in the grasses for thy roving fingers,<br>
And garlands leaflets for thy forehead's ease,<br>
When sunshine lingers.</p>

<p>When, labour done, he must away, turns he<br>
On April's threshold from his fair creating,<br>
And calleth unto Spring: &quot;Come, Spring—for see,<br>
The woods are waiting!&quot;</p><a name="17"></a><br>

<p>CONTRALTO</p>

<p>There lies within a great museum's hall,<br>
Upon a snowy bed of carven stone,<br>
A statue ever strange and mystical,<br>
With some fair fascination all its own.</p>

<p>And is it youth or is it maiden sweet,<br>
A goddess or a god come down to sway?<br>
Love fearful, hesitating, turns his feet,<br>
Nor any word's avowal will betray.</p>

<p>Sideways it lieth, with averted face,<br>
Stretching its lovely limbs, half mischievous,<br>
Unto the curious crowd, an idle grace<br>
Lighting its marble form luxurious.</p>

<p>For fashioning of its evil beauty brought<br>
The sexes twain each one its magic dower.<br>
Man whispers &quot;Aphrodite!&quot; in his thought,<br>
And woman &quot;Eros!&quot; wondering at its power.</p>

<p>Uncertain sex and certain grace, that seem<br>
To melt forever in a fountain's kiss,<br>
Waters that whelm the body as they gleam<br>
And merge, and it is one with Salmacis.</p>

<p>Ardent chimera, effort venturesome<br>
Of Art and Pleasure—figure fanciful!<br>
Into thy presence with delight I come,<br>
Loving thy beauty strange and multiple.</p>

<p>Though I may never close to thee draw nigh,<br>
How often have my glances pierced the taut,<br>
Straight fold of thine austerest drapery,<br>
Fast at the end about thine ankle caught!</p>

<p>O dream of poet passing every bound!<br>
My thought hath built a fancy of thy form,<br>
Till it is molten into silver sound,<br>
And boy and girl are one in cadence warm.</p>

<p>O tone divine, O richest tone of earth,<br>
The beautiful, bright statue's counterpart!<br>
Contralto, thou fantastical of birth,<br>
The voice's own Hermaphrodite thou art!</p>

<p>Thou art the plaintive dove, the linnet rare,<br>
Perched on one rose tree, mellow in one note.<br>
Thou art fair Juliet and Romeo fair,<br>
Singing across the night with one warm throat.</p>

<p>Thou art the young wife of the castellan,<br>
Chaffing an amorous page below her bower,—<br>
Upon her balcony the lady wan,<br>
The lover at the base of her high tower.</p>

<p>Thou art the yellow butterfly that swings,<br>
Pursuing soft a butterfly of snow,<br>
In spiral flights and subtle traversings,<br>
One winging high, the other winging low<i>;</i></p>

<p>The angel flitting up and down the gold<br>
Of the bright stair's aerial extent,<br>
The bell in whose alloy of mighty mould<br>
Arc voice of bronze and voice of silver blent</p>

Song with its true accompaniment, and grace<br>
Matched unto force,—the woman plighting vow<br>
To her Belov<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d with a close embrace;</p>

Her night before the embers of the fire,<br>
Deep in a conversation with her friend,<br>

Waging his righteous battle for a realm,<br>
Or Tancred with his breastplate luminous,<br>
Cuirassed and splendid with his sword and helm;</p>

<p>Or Desdemona with her willow song,<br>
Zerlina laughing at Mazetto, or<br>
Malcolm, his plaid upon his shoulder strong.<br>
Thee, O thou dear Contralto, I adore!</p>

<p>For these thou art, thou dearest charm of each,<br>
O fair Contralto, double-throated dove!<br>
The Kaled of a Lara, for thy speech,<br>
Thou mightest, like the lost Gulnare, prove,—</p>

<p>In whose heart-stirring, passionate caress<br>
In one wild, tremulous note there blend and mount<br>
A woman's sigh of plaintive tenderness,<br>
And virile accents from a firmer fount.</p><a name="18"></a><br>

<p>EYES OF BLUE</p>

Stands silent where the fleet<br>
And singing waters roll.</p>

<p>Her eyes, the mirrored note<br>
Of heaven, merge heaven's blue<br>
Bestarred of lights remote,<br>
With the sea's glaucous hue.</p>

<p>Within their languor set,<br>
Smiles sadness infinite.<br>
Tears make the sparkles wet,<br>
And tender grows the light.</p>

<p>Like sea-gulls from aloft<br>
That graze the ocean free,<br>
Her lashes flutter soft<br>
Upon an azure sea.</p>

<p>As slumbering treasures drowned<br>
Send shimmers lightly up,<br>
Gleams through the tide profound<br>
The King of Thule's cup.</p>

<p>Athwart the weedy swirl<br>
Brilliant, the waves upon,<br>

And ring of Solomon.</p>

That Schiller showed to us,<br>
Still under sea caught fast,<br>
Beams clear and luminous.</p>

<p>A magic in that gaze<br>
Draws me, mad venturer!<br>
Thus mermaid's magic ways<br>
Drew Harold Haarfager.</p>

<p>And all my soul unquelled<br>
Adown the gulf betrayed<br>
Dives, to the quest impelled<br>
Of some elusive shade.</p>

<p>The siren fitfully<br>
Displays her body's gleam,<br>
Her breast and arms that ply<br>
Through waves of amorous dream.</p>

<p>The water heaves and falls,<br>
Like breasts with passion's breath.<br>
The breeze insistent calls<br>
To me, and murmureth:</p>

<p><i>&quot;Come to my pearly bed!<br>
My ocean arms shall slip<br>
About thee: salt shall spread<br>
To honey on thy lip!</i></p>

<p><i>Oh, let the billows link<br>
Above us! Thou shalt, warm,<br>
From cup of kisses drink<br>
Oblivion of the storm!&quot;</i></p>

<p>THE OBELISK IN PARIS</p>

<p>Distant from my native land,<br>
Ever dull with ennui's pain,<br>
Lonely monolith I stand,<br>
In the snow and frost and rain.</p>

<p>And my shaft, once burnt to red<br>
In a flaming heaven's glare,<br>
Taketh on a pallor dead<br>
In this never azure air.</p>

<p>Oh, to stand again before<br>
Luxor's pylons, and the dear,<br>
Grim Colossi!—be once more<br>
My vermilion brother near!</p>

<p>Oh, to pierce the changeless blue,<br>
Where of old my peak upwon,<br>
With my shadow sharp and true<br>
Trace the footsteps of the sun!</p>

<p>Once, O Rameses! my tall mass<br>
Not the ages could destroy.<br>
But it fell cut down like grass.<br>

With my secret which outweighs<br>
Cycles of forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Sparrows lean defile my head,<br>
Where the ibis used to light,<br>
And the fierce gypaetus spread<br>
Talons gold and plumage white.</p>

<p>And the Seine, the drip of street,<br>
Unclean river, crime's abyss,<br>
Now befouls mine ancient feet,<br>
Which the Nile was wont to kiss:</p>

<p>Hoary Nile that, crowned and stern,<br>
To its lotus-laden shores<br>
From its ever bended urn<br>
Crocodiles for gudgeon pours!</p>

<p>Golden chariots gem-belit<br>
Of the Pharaohs' pageanting<br>
Grazed my side the cab-wheels hit,<br>
Bearing out the last poor king.</p>

Passed the priests, with stately pschent,<br>
And the mystic boat upbore,<br>
Emblemed and magnificent.</p>

<p>But to-day, profane and wan,<br>
Camped between two fountains wide,<br>
I behold the courtesan<br>

Safe from foul corruption's fear;<br>
Never hall where century-lined<br>
Generations disappear!</p>

<p>Sacred soil of hieroglyph,<br>

<p>Where the wasted columns brood,<br>
Lonely sentinel stand I,<br>
In eternal solitude<br>
Facing all infinity.</p>

To the horizon limitless<br>
Spreads earth's desert like a shroud<br>
Stained by yellow suns that press.</p>

<p>While above it, blue and clean,<br>
Is another desert cast—<br>
Sky where cloud is never seen,<br>
Pure, implacable, and vast.</p>

<p>And the Nile's great water-course<br>
Glazed with leaden pellicle<br>
Wrinkled by the river-horse<br>
Gleameth dead, unlustreful.</p>

<p>All about the flaming isles,<br>
By a turbid water spanned,<br>
Hot, rapacious crocodiles<br>
Swoon and sob upon the sand.</p>

Ibis, bird of classic fame,<br>
From a carven slab of stone<br>
Reads the moon-god's sacred name.</p>

<p>Jackals howl, hyenas grin,<br>
Famished hawks descend and cry.<br>
Down the heavy air they spin,<br>
Commas black against the sky.</p>

<p>These the sounds of solitude,<br>
Where the sphinxes yawn and doze,<br>
Dull and passionless of mood,<br>
Weary of their endless pose.</p>

<p>Child of sand's reflected shine,<br>
And of sun-rays fiercely bent,<br>
Is there ennui like to thine,<br>
Spleen of luminous Orient?</p>

<p>Thou it was cried &quot;Halt!&quot; of yore<br>
To satiety of kings.<br>
Thou hast crushed me more and more<br>
With thine awful weight of wings.</p>

<p>Here no zephyr of the sea<br>
Wipes the tears from skies that fill.<br>
Time himself leans wearily<br>
On the palaces long still.</p>

<p>Naught shall touch the features terse<br>
Of this dull, eternal spot.<br>
In this changing universe,<br>
Only Egypt changeth not!</p>

<p>When the ennui never ends,<br>
And I yearn a friend to hold,<br>
I've the fellahs, mummies, friends,<br>
Of the dynasties of old.</p>

<p>I behold a pillar pale,<br>
Or a chipped Colossus note,<br>
Watch a distant, gleaming sail<br>
Up and down the Nile afloat.</p>

<p>Oh, to seek my brother's side,<br>
In a Paris wondrous, grand,<br>
With his stately form to bide,<br>
In the public place to stand!</p>

<p>For he looks on living men,<br>
And they scan his pictures wrought<br>
By an hieratic pen,<br>
To be read by vision-thought.</p>

<p>Fountains fair as amethyst<br>
On his granite lightly pour<br>
All their irisated mist.<br>
He is growing young once more.</p>

<p>VETERANS OF THE OLD GUARD</p>

<p>(December 15)</p>

<p>Driven by ennui from my room,<br>
I walked along the Boulevard.<br>
'Twas in December's mist and gloom.<br>
A bitter wind was blowing hard.</p>

<p>And there I saw—strange thing to see!—<br>
In drizzle and in daylight drear,<br>
From out their dark abodes let free,<br>
Dim, spectral shadow-shapes appear.</p>

<p>Yet 't is by night's uncanny hours,<br>
By pallid German moonbeams cast<br>
On old dilapidated towers,<br>
That ghosts are wont to wander past.</p>

<p>It is by night's effulgent star<br>
In dripping robes that elves intrigue<br>
To bear beneath the nenuphar<br>
Their dancer dead of his fatigue.</p>

<p>At night's mysterious tide hath been<br>
The great review—of ballad writs—<br>
Wherein the Emperor, dimly seen,<br>
Numbered the shades of Austerlitz.</p>

<p>But phantoms near the <i>Gymnase?—</i>yea,<br>
And wet and miry phantoms, too,<br>
And close to the <i>Vari<font face="Times New Roman">é</font>t<font face=

<p>With yellow teeth and stained dress,<br>
And mossy skull and pierced shoon,<br>
Paris—Montmartre—behold it press,—<br>
Death in the very light of noon!</p>

<p>Ah, 't is a picture to be seen!<br>
Three veteran ghosts in uniform<br>
Of the Old Guard, and, spare and lean,<br>
Two ghost-hussars in daylight's storm.</p>

<p>The lithograph, you would surmise,<br>
Wherein one ray shines down upon<br>
The dead, that Raffet deifies,<br>
That pass and shout &quot;Napoleon!&quot;</p>

<p>No dead are these, whom nightly drum<br>
May rouse to battle fires that burn,<br>
But stragglers of the Old Guard, come<br>
To celebrate the grand return!</p>

<p>Since fighting in the fight supreme,<br>
One has grown thin, another stout;<br>
The coats that fitted once now seem<br>
Too small, too loose, or draggled out.</p>

<p>O epic rags! O tatters light,<br>
Starred with a cross! Heroic things<br>
Of ridicule, ye gleam more bright,<br>
More beautiful than robes of kings!</p>

<p>Limp feathers fluttering adorn<br>
The tawny colbacks worn and grim.<br>
The bullet and the moth have torn<br>
And riddled well the dolmans dim.</p>

<p>Their leathern breeches loosely hang<br>
In furrows on their lank thigh-bones,<br>
Their rusty sabres drag and clang,<br>
As heavily they scrape the stones.</p>

<p>Or some round belly firm and fat,<br>
Squeezed tight in tether labour-donned,<br>
Makes mirth and jest to chuckle at—<br>
Old hero quaint and cheveroned!</p>

<p>But do not mock and jeer, my lad.<br>
Salute him, rather, and, believe,<br>
Achilles he, of Iliad<br>
That Homer's self could not conceive.</p>

<p>Respect these men with battle signs<br>
That twenty skies have painted brown;<br>
Their scars that lengthen out the lines<br>
Of wrinkles age has written down;</p>

<p>Their skin whose colour deep and dun,<br>
Bared to the fronts of many foes,<br>
Tells us of Egypt's burning sun;<br>
Their locks that tell of Russia's snows.</p>

<p>And if they shake, no longer strong?<br>
Ah! Beresina's wind was cold.<br>
And if they limp? The way was long,<br>
From Cairo unto Vilna told.</p>

<p>If they be stiff? They'd but a flag<br>
For sheet to hold their bodies warm.<br>
And if a sleeve be loose, poor rag?<br>
'T is that a bullet tore an arm.</p>

<p>Mock not these veteran shapes bizarre,<br>
At whom the urchin laughs and gapes.<br>
They were the day, of which we are<br>
The evening, and the night, perhaps,—</p>

<p>Remembering if we forget—<br>
Red lancer, grenadier in blue,<br>
With faces to the Column set,<br>
As to their only altar true.</p>

<p>There, proud of pain each scar denotes,<br>
And of long miseries gone by,<br>
They feel beneath their shabby coats<br>
The heart of France beat mightily.</p>

<p>And so our smiles are steeped in tears,<br>
Seeing this holy carnival,<br>
This picture wan that reappears,<br>
Like morning after midnight's ball.</p>

<p>And, cleaving heaven its own to claim,<br>
Wide the Grand Army's eagle spreads<br>
Its golden wings, like glory's flame,<br>
Above their dear and hallowed heads.</p><a name="24"></a><br>
<br>

<p>SEA-GLOOM</p>

<p>The sea-gulls restless gleam and glance,<br>
The mad white coursers cleave the length<br>
Of ocean as they rear and prance<br>
And toss their manes in stormy strength.</p>

<p>The day is ending. Raindrops choke<br>
The sunset furnaces. The gloom<br>
Brings the great steamboat spitting smoke,<br>
And beating down its long black plume.</p>

<p>And I, more wan than heaven wide,<br>
For land of soot and fog am bound,<br>
For land of smoke and suicide—<br>
And right good weather have I found!</p>

<p>How eagerly I now would pierce<br>
The gulf that groweth wild and hoar!<br>
The vessel rocks. The waves are fierce.<br>
The salt wind freshens more and more.</p>

<p>Ah! bitter is my soul's unrest.<br>
The very ocean sighing heaves<br>
In pity its unhopeful breast,<br>
Like some good friend that knows and grieves.</p>

<p>Let be—lost love's despair supreme!<br>
Let be—illusions fair that rose<br>
And fell from pedestals of dream!<br>
One leap! The dark wet ridges close.</p>

<p>Away! ye sufferings gone by,<br>
That evermore returning brood,<br>
And press the wounds that sleeping lie,<br>
To make them weep afresh their blood.</p>

<p>Away! regret, whose crimson heart<br>
Hath seven swords. Yea, One, maybe,<br>
Doth know the anguish and the smart—<br>
Mother of Seven Sorrows, She!</p>

<p>Each ghostly grief sinks down the vast,<br>
And struggles with the waves that throb<br>
To close about it, and at last<br>
Drown it forever with a sob.</p>

<p>Soul's ballast, treasures of life's hand,<br>
Sink! and we'll wreck together down.<br>
Pale on the pillow of the sand<br>
I'll rest me well at evening brown.</p>

<p>But, now, a woman, as I gaze,<br>
Sits in the bridge's darker nook,<br>
A woman, who doth sweetly raise<br>
Her eyes to mine in one long look.</p>

<p>'T is Sympathy with outstretched arms,<br>
Who smileth to me through the gray<br>
Of dusk with all her thousand charms.<br>
Hail, azure eyes! Green sea, away!</p>

<p>The sea-gulls restless gleam and glance.<br>
The mad white coursers cleave the length<br>
Of Ocean as they rear and prance<br>
And toss their manes in stormy strength.</p><a name="25"></a><br>

<p>TO A ROSE-COLOURED GOWN</p>

<p>How I love you in the robes<br>
That disrobe so well your charms!<br>
Your dear breasts, twin ivory globes,<br>
And your bare sweet pagan arms.</p>

<p>Frail as frailest wing of bee,<br>
Fresher than the heart of rose,<br>
All the fabric delicate, free,<br>
Round your body gleams and glows,</p>

<p>Till from skin to silken thread,<br>
Silver shivers lightly win,<br>
And the rosy gown have shed<br>
Roses on the creamy skin.</p>

<p>Whence have you the mystic thing,<br>
Made of very flesh of you,<br>
Living mesh to mix and cling<br>
With your glorious body's hue?</p>

<p>Did you take it from the rud<br>
Of the dawn? From Venus' shell?<br>
From a breast-flower nigh to bud?<br>
From a rose about to swell?</p>

<p>Doth the texture have its dye<br>
From some blushing bashfulness?<br>
No—your portraits do not lie—<br>
Beauty beauty's form shall guess!</p>

<p>Down you cast your garment fair,<br>
Art-dreamed, sweet Reality,<br>
Like Borghese's princess, rare<br>
For Canova's mastery!</p>

<p>Ah! the folds are lips of fire<br>
Sweeping round your lovely form<br>
In a folly of desire,<br>
With a weft of kisses warm!</p><a name="26"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE WORLD'S MALICIOUS</p>

<p>Ah, little one, the world's malicious!<br>
With mocking smiles thy beauty greeting.<br>
It says that in thy breast capricious<br>
A watch, and not a heart, is beating.</p>

<p>Yet like the sea thy breast is swelling<br>
With all the wild, tumultuous power<br>
A tide of blood sends pulsing, welling,<br>
Beneath thy flesh in life's young hour.</p>

<p>Ah, little one, the world is spiteful!<br>
It says thy vivid eyes are fooling,<br>
And that they have their charm delightful<br>
From faithful, diplomatic schooling.</p>

<p>Yet on thy lashes' shifting curtain<br>
An iridescent tear-drop trembles,<br>
Like dew unbidden and uncertain,<br>
That no well-water's gleam resembles.</p>

<p>Ah, little one, the world reviles thee!<br>
It says thou hast no spirit's favour,<br>
That verse, which seemingly beguiles thee,<br>
Hath unto thee a Sanskrit savour.</p>

<p>Yet to thy crimson lips inviting,<br>
Intelligence's bee of laughter,<br>
At every flash of wit alighting,<br>
Allures and gleams, and lingers after.</p>

<p>Ah, little one, I know the trouble!<br>
Thou lovest me. The world, it guesses.<br>
Leave me, and hear its praises bubble:—<br>
&quot;<i>What heart, what spirit, she possesses!&quot;</i></p><a name="27"></a><br>

<p>INES DE LAS SIERRAS</p>

<p>TO PETRA CAMARA</p>

<p>In Spain, as Nodier's pen has told,<br>
Three officers in night's mid hours<br>
Came on a castle dark and old,<br>
With sunken eaves and mouldering towers,</p>

<p>A true Anne Radcliffe type it was,<br>
With ruined halls and crumbling rooms<br>
And windows graven by the claws<br>
Of Goya's bats that ranged the glooms.</p>

<p>Now while they feasted, gazed upon<br>
By ancient portraits standing guard<br>
In their ancestral frames, anon<br>
A sudden cry rang thitherward.</p>

<p>Forth from a distant corridor<br>
That many a moonbeam's pallid hue<br>
Fretted fantastically o'er,<br>
A wondrous phantom sped in view.</p>

<p>With bodice high and hair comb-tipped,<br>
A woman, running, dancing, hied.<br>
Adown the dappled gloom she dipped,—<br>
An iridescent form descried.</p>

<p>A languid, dead, voluptuous mood<br>
Filled every act's abandon brief,<br>
Till at the door she stopped, and stood<br>
Sinister, lovely past belief.</p>

<p>Her raiment crumpled in the tomb<br>
Showed here and there a spangle's foil.<br>
At every start a faded bloom<br>
Dropped petals in her hair's black coil.</p>

<p>A dull scar crossed her bloodless throat,<br>
As of a knife. Like rattle chill<br>
Of teeth, her castanets she smote<br>
Full in their faces awed and still.</p>

<p>Ah, poor bacchante, sad of grace!<br>
So wild the sweetness of her spell,<br>
The curv<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d lips in her white face<br>
Had lured a saint from heaven to hell!</p>

<p>Like darkling birds her eyelashes<br>
Upon her cheek lay fluttering light.<br>
Her kirtle's swinging cadences<br>
Displayed her limbs of lustrous white.</p>

<p>She bowed amid a mist of gyres,<br>
And with her hand, as dancers may,<br>
Like flowers she gathered up desires,<br>
And grouped them in a bright bouquet.</p>

<p>Was it a wraith or woman seen,<br>
A thing of dreams, or blood and flesh,<br>
The flame that burst from out the sheen<br>
Of beauty's undulating mesh?</p>

<p>It was a phantom of the past,<br>
It was the Spain of olden keep,<br>
Who, at the sound of cheer at last,<br>
Upbounded from her icy sleep,</p>

<p>In one bolero mad, supreme,<br>
Rough-resurrected, powerful,<br>
Showing beneath her kirtle's gleam<br>
The ribbon wrested from the bull.</p>

<p>About her throat the scar of red<br>
The deathblow was, dealt silently<br>
Unto a generation dead<br>
By every new-born century.</p>

<p>I saw this self-same phantom fleet,<br>
All Paris ringing with her praise,<br>
When soft, diaphanous, mystic, sweet,<br>
La Petra Camara held its gaze,—</p>

<p>Closing her eyes with languor rare,<br>
Impassive, passionate of art,<br>
And, like the murdered Ines fair,<br>
Dancing, a dagger in her heart.</p><a name="28"></a><br>
<br>

<p>ODELET</p>

<p>AFTER ANACREON</p>

<p>Poet of her face divine,<br>
Curb this over-zeal of thine!<br>
Doves wing frighted from the ground<br>
At a step's too sudden sound,<br>
And her passion is a dove,<br>
Frighted by too bold a love.<br>
Mute as marble Hermes wait<br>
By the blooming hawthorn-gate.<br>
Thou shalt see her wings expand,<br>
She shall flutter to thy hand.<br>
On thy forehead thou shalt know<br>
Something like a breath of snow,<br>
Or of pinions pure that beat<br>
In a whirl of whiteness sweet.<br>
And the dove, grown venturesome,<br>
Shall upon thy shoulder come,<br>
And its rosy beak shall sip<br>
From the nectar of thy lip.</p><a name="29"></a><br>
<br>

<p>SMOKE</p>

<p>Beneath yon tree sits humble<br>
A squalid, hunchbacked house,<br>
With roof precipitous,<br>
And mossy walls that crumble.</p>

<p>Bolted and barred the shanty.<br>
But from its must and mould,<br>
Like breath of lips in cold,<br>
Comes respiration scanty.</p>

<p>A vapour upward welling,<br>
A slender, silver streak,<br>
To God bears tidings meek<br>
Of the soul in the little dwelling.</p><a name="30"></a><br>
<br>

<p>APOLLONIA</p>

<p>Fair Apollonia, name august,<br>
Greek echo of the sacred vale,<br>
Great name whose harmonies robust<br>
Thee as Apollo's sister hail!</p>

<p>Struck with the plectrum on the lyre,<br>
And in melodious beauty sung,<br>
Brighter than love's and glory's fire,<br>
It resonant rings upon the tongue.</p>

<p>At such a classic sound as this,<br>
The elves plunge down their German lake.<br>
Alone the Delphian worthy is<br>
So lustreful a name to take,—</p>

<p>Pythia! when in her flowing dress<br>
She mounts her place with feet unshod,<br>
And, priestess white and prophetess,<br>
Wistful awaits the tardy god.</p><a name="31"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE BLIND MAN</p>

<p>A blind man walks without the gate,<br>
Wild-staring as an owl by day,<br>
Fumbling his flute betimes and late,<br>
Along the way.</p>

<p>He pipeth, weary wretch and worn,<br>
A roundel shrill and obsolete.<br>
The spectre of a dog forlorn<br>
Attends his feet.</p>

<p>For him the days go lustreless.<br>
Invisible life with beat and roar<br>
He heareth like a torrent press<br>
Around, before.</p>

<p>What strange chimeras haunt his head<i><br></i>And on his mind's bedarkened
space,<br>
What characters unheard, unread,<br>
Doth fancy trace?</p>

<p>Thus down Venetian leads of doom,<br>
Wan prisoners ensepulchred<br>
In palpable, undying gloom<br>
Have graven their word.</p>

<p>And yet perchance when life's last spark<br>
Death speeds unto eternal night,<br>
The tomb-bred soul, within the dark,<br>
Shall see the light.</p><a name="32"></a><br>

<p>SONG</p>

<p>In April earth is white and rose<br>
Like youth and love, now tendering<br>
Her smiles, now fearful to disclose<br>
Her virgin heart unto the Spring.</p>

<p>In June, a little pale and worn,<br>
And full at heart of vague desire,<br>
She hideth in the yellow corn,<br>
With sunburned Summer to respire.</p>

<p>In August, wild Bacchante, she<br>
Her bosom bares to Autumn shapes,<br>
And on the tiger-skin flung free,<br>
Draws forth the purple blood of grapes.</p>

<p>And in December, shrivelled, old,<br>
Bepowdered white from foot to head,<br>
In dream she wakens Winter cold,<br>
That sleeps beside her in her bed.</p><a name="33"></a><br>

<p>WINTER FANTASIES</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Red of nose and white of face,<br>
Bent his desk of ice before,<br>
Winter doth his theme retrace<br>
In the season's quatuor,—</p>

<p>Beating measure and the ground<br>
With a frozen foot for us,<br>
Singing with uncertain sound<br>
Olden tunes and tremulous.</p>

<p>And as Haendel's wig sublime<br>
Trembling shook its powder, oft<br>
Flutter as he taps his time<br>
Snow-flakes in a flurry soft.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>In the Tuileries fount the swan<br>
Meets the ice, and all the trees,<br>
As in land of fairies wan,<br>
Arc bedecked with filigrees.</p>

<p>Flowers of frost in vases low<br>
Stand unquickened and unstirred,<br>
And we trace upon the snow<br>
Starred footsteps of a bird.</p>

<p>Where with lightest raiment spanned,<br>
Venus was with Phocion met,<br>
Now has Winter's hoary hand<br>
Clodion's &quot;Chilly Maiden&quot; set.</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>Women pass in ermine dress,<br>
Sable, too, and miniver,<br>
And the shivering goddesses<br>
Haste to don the fashion's fur.</p>

<p>Venus of the Brine comes forth,<br>
In her hooded mantle's fluff.<br>
Flora, blown by breezes North,<br>
Hides her fingers in her muff.</p>

<p>And the shepherdesses round<br>
Of Coustou and Coysevox,<br>
Finding scarves too light have wound<br>
Furs about their throats of snow.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>Heavy doth the North bedrape<br>
Paris mode from foot to top,<br>
As o'er fair Athenian shape<br>
Scythian should a bearskin drop.</p>

<p>Over winter's garments meet,<br>
Everywhere we see the fur,<br>
Flung with Russian pomp, and sweet<br>
With the fragrant vetiver.</p>

<p>Pleasure's laughing glances feast<br>
Far amid the statues, where<br>
From the bristles of a beast<br>
Bursts a Venus torso fair!</p>

<p>If you venture hitherward,<br>
With a tender veil to cheat<br>
Glances over-daring, guard<br>
Well your Andalusian feet!</p>

<p>Snow shall fashion like a frame<br>
On your foot's impression rare,<br>
Signing with each step your name<br>
On the carpet soft and vair.</p>

<p>Thus were surly master led<br>
To the hidden trysting-place,<br>
Where his Psyche, faintly red,<br>
Were beheld in Love's embrace.</p><a name="34"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE BROOK</p>

<p>Near a great water's waste<br>
A brook mid rock and spar<br>
Came bubbling up in haste,<br>
As though to travel far.</p>

<p>It sang: &quot;What joy to rise!<br>
'T was dismal under ground.<br>
I mirror now the skies.<br>
My banks with green abound.</p>

<p>&quot;Forget-me-nots—how fair!<br>
Beseech me from the grass;<br>
Wings frolic in the air,<br>
And graze me as they pass.</p>

<p>&quot;I yet shall be—who knows?—<br>
A river winding down,<br>
And greeting as it flows<br>
Valley and cliff and town.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll broider with my spray<br>
Stone bridge and granite quay,<br>
And bear great ships away<br>
Unto the long wide sea.&quot;</p>

<p>So planned it, babbling by,<br>
As water boiling fast<br>
Within a basin high,<br>
To top its brim at last.</p>

<p>Cradle by tomb is crossed.<br>
Giants are early dead.<br>
Scarce born, the brook was lost<br>
Within a lake's deep bed.</p><a name="35"></a><br>
<br>

<p>TOMBS AND FUNERAL PYRES</p>

<p>No grim cadaver set its flaw<br>
In happy days of pagan art,<br>
And man, content with what he saw,<br>
Stripped not the veil from beauty's heart.</p>

<p>No form once loved that buried lay,<br>
A hideous spectre to appal,<br>
Dropped bit by bit its flesh away,<br>
As one by one our garments fall;</p>

<p>Or, when the days had drifted by<br>
And sundered shrank the vaulted stones,<br>
Showed naked to the daring eye<br>
A motley heap of rattling bones.</p>

<p>But, rescued from the funeral pyre,<br>
Life's ashen, light residuum<br>
Lay soft, and, spent the cleansing fire,<br>
The urn held sweet the body's sum,—</p>

<p>The sum of all that earth may claim<br>
Of the soul's butterfly, soul passed,—<br>
All that is left of spended flame<br>
Upon the tripod at the last.</p>

<p>Between acanthus leaves and flowers<br>
In the white marble gaily went<br>
Loves and bacchantes all the hours,<br>
Dancing about the monument.</p>

<p>At most, a little Genius wild<br>
Trampled a flame out in the gloom,<br>
And art's harmonious flowering smiled<br>
Upon the sadness of the tomb.</p>

<p>The tomb was then a pleasant place.<br>
As bed of child that slumbereth,<br>
With many a fair and laughing grace<br>
The joy of life surrounded death.</p>

<p>Then death concealed its visage gaunt,<br>
Whose sockets deep, and sunken nose,<br>
And railing mouth our spirits haunt,<br>
Past any dream that horror shows.</p>

<p>The monster in flesh raiment clad<br>
Hid deep its spectral form uncouth,<br>
And virgin glances, beauty-glad,<br>
Sped frankly to the naked youth.</p>

<p>Twas only at Trimalchio's board<br>
A little skeleton made sign,<br>
An ivory plaything unabhorred,<br>
To bid the feasters to the wine.</p>

<p>Gods, whom Art ever must avow,<br>
Ruled the marmoreal sky's demesne.<br>
Olympus yields to Calvary, now;<br>
Jupiter to the Nazarene!</p>

<p>Voices are calling, &quot;Pan is dead!&quot;<br>
Dusk deepeneth within, without.<br>
On the black sheet of sorrow spread,<br>
The whitened skeleton gleams out.</p>

<p>It glideth to the headstone bare,<br>
And signs it with a paraph wild,<br>
And hangs a wreath of bones to glare<br>
Upon the charnel death-defiled.</p>

<p>It lifts the coffin-lid and quaffs<br>
The musty air, and peers within,<br>
Displays a ring of ribs, and laughs<br>
Forever with its awful grin.</p>

<p>It urges unto Death's fleet dance<br>
The Emperor, the Pope, the King,<br>
And makes the pallid steed to prance,<br>
And low the doughty warrior fling;—</p>

<p>Behind the courtesan steals up,<br>
And makes wry faces in her glass;<br>
Drinks from the sick man's trembling cup;<br>
Delves in the miser's golden mass.</p>

<p>Above the team it whirls the thong,<br>
With bone for goad to hurry it,<br>
Follows the plowman's way along,<br>
And guides the furrows to a pit.</p>

<p>It comes, the uninvited guest,<br>
And lurks beneath the banquet chair,<br>
Unseen from the pale bride to wrest<br>
Her little silken garter fair.</p>

<p>The number swells: the young give hand<br>
Unto the old, and none may flee.<br>
The irresistible saraband<br>
Compelleth all humanity.</p>

<p>Forth speeds the tall, ungainly fright,<br>
Playing the rebeck, dancing mad,<br>
Against the dark a frame of white,<br>
As Holbein drew it—horror-sad;—</p>

<p>Or if the times be frivolous,<br>
Trusses the shroud about its hips:<br>
Then like a Cupid mischievous,<br>
Across the ballet-room it skips,</p>

<p>And unto carven tombs it flies,<br>
Where marchionesses rest demure,<br>
Weary of love, in exquisite guise,<br>
In chapels dim and pompadour.</p>

<p>But hide thy hideous form at last,<br>
Worm-eaten actor! Long enough<br>
In death's wan melodrama cast,<br>
Thou'st played thy part without rebuff.</p>

<p>Come back, come back, O ancient Art!<br>
And cover with thy marble's gleam<br>
This Gothic skeleton! Each part<br>
Consume, ye flames of fire supreme!</p>

<p>If man be then a creature made<br>
In God's own image, to aspire,<br>
When shattered must the image fade,<br>
Let the lone fragments feed the fire!</p>

<p>Immortal form! Rise thou in flame<br>
Again to beauty's fount of bloom<br>
Let not thy clay endure the shame,<br>
The degradation of the tomb!</p><a name="36"></a><br>

<p>BJORN'S BANQUET</p>

<p>Bjorn, odd and lonely cenobite,<br>
High on a barren rock's plateau,<br>
Far out of time's and the world's sight,<br>
Dwells in a castle none may know.</p>

<p>No modern thought may violate<br>
His darkened and secluded hall.<br>
Bjorn bolts with care his postern-gate,<br>
And barricades his castle wall.</p>

<p>When others wait the rising sun,<br>
He from his mouldering parapet<br>
Still contemplates the valley dun,<br>
Where he beheld the red sun set.</p>

<p>Securely doth the past enlock<br>
His retrospective spirit lone.<br>
The pendulum within his clock<br>
Was broken centuries agone.</p>

<p>Waking the echoes wanders he<br>
Beneath his feudal arches drear,<br>
His ringing footsteps seemingly<br>
Followed by other footsteps clear.</p>

<p>Nor priests nor friends with him make bold,<br>
Nor burghers plain nor gentlemen;<br>
But his ancestral portraits hold<br>
A parley with him now and then.</p>

<p>And of a midnight, sparing him<br>
The ennui of a lonely cup,<br>
Bjorn, harbouring a gloomy whim,<br>
Invites his ancestors to sup.</p>

<p>Forth stepping at the hour's grim stroke,<br>
Come phantoms armed from foot to head.<br>
Bjorn, quaking, to the solemn folk<br>
Proffers with state the goblet red.</p>

<p>To seat itself each panoply<br>
With joints that grumble in revolt<br>
Maketh an angle with its knee,<br>
That creaketh like a rusty bolt;</p>

<p>Till all at once the suit of mail,<br>
Rude coffin of an absent bulk,<br>
Cleaving the silence with a wail,<br>
Falls in its chair, a clanking hulk.</p>

<p>Landgraves and burgraves, spare and stout,<br>
Come down from heaven or up from hell,<br>
The iron guests of many a bout,<br>
Arc bound within the midnight spell.</p>

<p>Their blow-indented helmets bear<br>
Heraldic beasts that bay and grin,<br>
Athwart the shades the red lights glare<br>
On crest and ancient lambrequin.</p>

<p>Each empty, open casque now seems<br>
Like to the helms of heraldries,<br>
Save for two strange and livid gleams<br>
That issue forth in threatening wise.</p>

<p>Seated is each old combatant<br>
In the vast hall, at Bjorn's behest,<br>
And the uncertain shadows grant<br>
A swarthy page to every guest.</p>

<p>The liquors in the candle-shine<br>
Take on suspicious purples. All<br>
The viands in their gravy's wine<br>
Grow lurid and fantastical.</p>

<p>Sometimes a breastplate glitters bright,<br>
A morion speeds its flashes wroth,<br>
A rondelle from a hand of might<br>
Drops heavily upon the cloth.</p>

<p>Heard are the softly flapping wings<br>
Of unseen bats. The shimmer flicks<br>
Upon the carven panellings<br>
The banners of the heretics.</p>

<p>The stiffly bended gauntlets play<br>
In the dull glow incarnadine,<br>
And, creaking, to the helmets gray<br>
Pour bumpers full of Rhenish wine;</p>

<p>Or with their daggers keen of blade<br>
Carve boars upon the plates of gold.<br>
The corridor's uncanny shade<br>
Hath clamours vague and manifold.</p>

<p>The orgy waxes riotsome—<br>
One could not hear God's voice for it—<br>
For when a phantom sups from home,<br>
What wrong if he carouse a bit?</p>

<p>Now every ghostly care they drown<br>
With jokes and jeers and loud guffaws.<br>
A wine-cascade is running down<br>
Each rusty helmet's iron jaws.</p>

<p>The full and rounded hauberks bulge,<br>
And to the neck the river mounts.<br>
Their eyes with liquid fire effulge.<br>
They're howling drunk, these valiant counts!</p>

<p>One through the salad idly wields<br>
A foot; another scolds the sick.<br>
Some like the lions on their shields<br>
With gaping mouths the fancy trick.</p>

<p>In voice still hoarse from silence long<br>
In the tomb's dampness and restraint,<br>
Max playfully intones a song<br>
Of thirteen hundred, crude and quaint.</p>

<p>Albrecht, of quarrelsome repute,<br>
Stirs right and left a war intense,<br>
And drubs about with fist and foot,<br>
As once he drubbed the Saracens.</p>

<p>And heated Fritz his helmet doffs,<br>
Not deeming he's a headless trunk.<br>
Then down pell-mell mid roars and scoffs<br>
Together roll the phantoms drunk.</p>

<p>Ah! 'T is a hideous battle-ground,<br>
Where pots and weapons bang and scud,<br>
Where every dead man through some wound<br>
Doth vomit victuals up for blood.</p>

<p>And Bjorn observes them, sad of eye,<br>
And haggard, while athwart the panes<br>
The dawn comes creeping stealthily,<br>
With blue, thin lights, and darkness wanes.</p>

<p>The prostrate mass of rusty brown<br>
Pales like a torch in daylight's room,<br>
Until the drunkest pours him down<br>
At last the stirrup-cup of doom.</p>

<p>The cock crows loud. And with the day<br>
Once more with haughty mien and bold,<br>
Their revel-weary heads they lay<br>
Upon their marble pillows cold.</p><a name="37"></a><br>

<p>THE WATCH</p>

<p>Now twice my watch have I taken,<br>
And twice as I've gazing sat,<br>
The hand has pointed unshaken<br>
To one—and it's long past that!</p>

<p>The clock's light cadences linger.<br>
The sun-dial laughs from the lawn,<br>
And points with a long, gaunt finger<br>
The path that its shade has drawn.</p>

<p>A steeple ironically<br>
Calls the true time to me.<br>
The belfry bell makes tally<br>
And taunts me with accents free.</p>

<p>Ah, dead is the wretch! I sought not,<br>
Last night, to my reverie sold,<br>
Its ruby circle! I thought not<br>
Of glimmering key of gold!</p>

<p>No longer I see with pleasure<br>
The spring of the balance-wheel<br>
Flit hither and there at measure,<br>
Like a butterfly form of steel.</p>

<p>When Hippogriff bears me, yearning,<br>
Through skies of another sphere,<br>
My soul-reft body goes turning<br>
Wherever the steed may veer.</p>

<p>Eternity still is giving<br>
Its gaze to the lifeless face.<br>
Time seeketh the heart once living,<br>
His ear at the old watch-case,—</p>

<p>That heart whose regular motion<br>
Was followed within my breast<br>
By wave-beats of life's full ocean!<br>
Ah well! the watch is at rest.</p>

<p>But its brother is beating ever,<br>
Steadfast and sturdy kept<br>
By One Who forgetteth never,—<br>
Who wound it the while I slept.</p><a name="38"></a><br>

<p>THE MERMAIDS</p>

<p>There's a sketch you may discover<br>
By an artist of degree<br>
Rime and metre quarrel over—<br>
Th<font face="Times New Roman">é</font>ophile Kniatowski.</p>

<p>On the snowy foam that fringes<br>
All the mantle of the brine,<br>
Radiant with the sunlight's tinges,<br>
Three mermaidens softly shine.</p>

<p>Like the drown<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d lilies dancing<br>
Turn they, as the spiral wave<br>
Buoys their bodies hiding, glancing,<br>
As they sink and rise and lave.</p>

<p>In their golden hair for dowers<br>
They have twined with beauteous hands<br>
Shells for diadems, and flowers<br>
From the deep wild under sands.</p>

<p>Oysters pour a pearly hoarding<br>
Their enrapturing throats to gem,<br>
And the wave, its wealth according,<br>
Tosses other pearls to them.</p>

<p>Borne above the crest of ocean<br>
By a Triton hand and strong,<br>
Twine they, beautiful of motion,<br>
Under gleaming tresses long.</p>

<p>And the crystal water under,<br>
Down the blue the glories pale<br>
Of each lovely form of wonder,<br>
Tapered to a shimmering tail.</p>

<p>Ah! But who the scaly swimmers<br>
Would behold in modern day—<br>
When a bust of ivory glimmers,<br>
Cool from kisses of the spray?</p>

<p>Look! Oh, mingled truth and fable!<br>
O'er the horizon steady plied,<br>
Comes a vessel proud and stable,<br>
Toward the mermaids terrified!</p>

<p>Tricoloured its flag is flaunted,<br>
And it vomits vapour red,<br>
And it beats the billows daunted,<br>
Till the nymphs dive low for dread.</p>

<p>Fearlessly they did beleaguer<br>
Triremes immemorial,<br>
And the dolphins arched and eager<br>
Waited for Arion's call.</p>

<p>This of old. But now the steamer—<br>
Vulcan hurtling Venus' charms,—<br>
Would destroy the siren gleamer,<br>
With her fair, nude tail and arms.</p>

<p>Farewell myth! The boat that passes<br>
Thinks to see on silver bar,<br>
Where the widening billow glasses,<br>
Porpoises that plunge afar.</p><a name="39"></a><br>
<br>

<p>TWO LOVE-LOCKS</p>

<p>Reviving languorous dreaming<br>
Of conquered, conquering eye,<br>
Upon thy forehead gleaming,<br>
Two fairest love-locks lie.</p>

<p>I see them softly nesting,<br>
Of wondrous, golden sheen,<br>
Like little wheels come resting<br>
From car of Mab the Queen;</p>

<p>Or bows of Cupid ready<br>
To let the arrows fly,<br>
Bent circlewise and steady<br>
For archer's mastery.</p>

<p>One heart have I of passion.<br>
Yet two love-locks are thine!<br>
O brow of fickle fashion!<br>
Whose heart is caught with mine?</p><a name="40"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE TEA-ROSE</p>

<p>Most beautiful of all the roses<br>
Is this half-open bud, whose bare,<br>
Unpetalled heart a dream discloses<br>
Of carmine very faint and fair.</p>

<p>I wonder, was it once a white rose,<br>
Till butterfly too ardent spoke<br>
A language soft, and in the light rose<br>
A shyer, warmer tint awoke?</p>

<p>Its delicate fabric hath the colour<br>
Of lovely and velutinous skin.<br>
Its perfect freshness maketh duller<br>
Environing hues incarnadine.</p>

<p>For as some rare patrician features<br>
Eclipse the brows of ruddier gleam,<br>
So masquerade as rustic creatures<br>
Gay sisters of this rose supreme.</p>

<p>But, dear one, if your hand caress it,<br>
And raise it for its sweet perfume,<br>
Ere yet your velvet cheek shall press it,<br>
'T will fade before a fairer bloom.</p>

<p>No rose in all the world so tender,<br>
That gloweth in the springtime fleet,<br>
But shall its every charm surrender<br>
Unto your seventeen years, my sweet.</p>

<p>A face hath more than petal's power:<br>
A pure heart's blood that blushing flows<br>
O'er youth's nobility, is flower<br>
High sovereign over every rose.</p><a name="41"></a><br>
<br>

<p>CARMEN</p>

<p>Slender is Carmen, of lissome guise,<br>
Her hair is black as the midnight's heart;<br>
Dark circles are under her gypsy eyes,<br>
Her swarthy skin is the devil's art.</p>

<p>The women will mock at her form and face;<br>
But the men will follow her all the day.<br>
Toledo's Archbishop (now save His Grace!)<br>
Tones his mass at her knees, they say.</p>

<p>Nestled in warmth of her amber neck<br>
Lies a massive coil, till she fling it down<br>
To be a raiment to frame and deck<br>
Her delicate body from foot to crown.</p>

<p>Then out from her pallid face with power<br>
Her witching, terrible smiles compel.<br>
Her mouth is a mystical poison-flower<br>
That hath drawn its crimson from hearts in hell.</p>

<p>The haughtiest beauty must yield her fame,<br>
When this strange vision shall dusk her sky.<br>
For Carmen rules, and her glance's flame<br>
Shall set the torch to satiety.</p>

<p>Wild, graceless Carmen!—Though yet this be,<br>
Savour she hath of a world undreamt,<br>
Of a world of wonder, whose salt young sea<br>
Provoked a Venus to rise and tempt.</p><a name="42"></a><br>

<p>WHAT THE SWALLOWS SAY</p>

<p>AN AUTUMN SONG</p>

<p>The dry, brown leaves have dropped forlorn,<br>
And lie amid the golden grass.<br>
The wind is fresh both eve and morn.<br>
But where are summer days, alas!</p>

<p>The tardy flowers the autumn stayed<br>
For latter treasures now unfold.<br>
The dahlia dons its gay cockade,<br>
Its flaming cap the marigold.</p>

<p>Rain stirs the pool with pelt and shock.<br>
The swallows to the roof repair,<br>
Confabulating as they flock<br>
And feel the winter in the air.</p>

<p>By hundreds gather they to vow<br>
Their little yearnings and intents.<br>
Saith one: &quot;'T is fair in Athens now,<br>
Upon the sun-warm battlements!</p>

<p>&quot;Thither I go to take my nap<br>
Upon the Parthenon high and free.<br>
My cornice nest is in the gap<br>
A cannon-ball made there for me.&quot;</p>

<p>And one: &quot;A ceiling meets my needs<br>
Within a Smyrna coffee-house,<br>
Where Hadjis tell their amber beads<br>
Upon the threshold luminous.</p>

<p>&quot;I go and come above the folk,<br>
While their chibouques their clouds upfling.<br>
I skim along through silver smoke,<br>
And graze the turbans with my wing.&quot;</p>

<p>Another: &quot;There's a triglyph gray<br>
On one of Baalbec's temples high.<br>
'T is there I go to brood all day<br>
Above my little family.&quot;</p>

<p>Another calleth, &quot;My address<br>
Is settled: 'At the Knights of Rhodes.'<br>
In a dark colonnade's recess<br>
I'll make the snuggest of abodes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Old age hath made me slow for flight,&quot;<br>
Declares a fifth; &quot;I'll rest at even<br>
On Malta's terraces of white,<br>
Where blue sea melts to blue of heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>A sixth: &quot;In Cairo is my home,<br>
Up in a minaret's retreat:<br>
A twig or two, a bit of loam—<br>
My winter lodgings are complete.&quot;</p>

<p>A last: &quot;The Second Cataract<br>
Shall mark my place—the nest of brown<br>
A granite king doth hold intact<br>
Within the circle of his crown.&quot;</p>

<p>And all together sing: &quot;What miles<br>
To-morrow shall have stretched beneath<br>
Our fleeing swarm:—remembered isles,<br>
Snow peaks, vast waters, lands of heath!&quot;</p>

<p>With calls and cries and beat of wings,<br>
Grown eager now and venturesome,<br>
The swallows hold their twitterings,<br>
To see the blight of winter come.</p>

<p>And I—I understand them all,<br>
Because the poet is a bird,—<br>
Oh! but a sorry bird, and thrall<br>
To a great lack, pressed heavenward.</p>

<p>It's Oh for wings! to seek the star,<br>
To count the seas when day is done,<br>
To breast the air with swallows far,<br>
To verdant spring, to golden sun!</p><a name="43"></a><br>

<p>CHRISTMAS</p>

<p>Black is the sky and white the ground.<br>
O ring, ye bells, your carol's grace!<br>
The Child is born! A love profound<br>
Beams o'er Him from His Mother's face.</p>

<p>No silken woof of costly show<br>
Keeps off the bitter cold from Him.<br>
But spider-webs have drooped them low,<br>
To be His curtain soft and dim.</p>

<p>Now trembles on the straw downspread<br>
The Little Child, the Star beneath.<br>
To warm Him in His holy bed,<br>
Upon Him ox and ass do breathe.</p>

<p>Snow hangs its fringes on the byre.<br>
The roof stands open to the tryst<br>
Of aureoled saints, that sweetly choir<br>
To shepherds, &quot;Come, behold the Christ!&quot;</p><a name="44"></a><br>

<p>THE DEAD CHILD'S PLAYTHINGS</p>

<p>Marie comes no more at call.<br>
She has wandered from her play.<br>
Ah, how pitifully small<br>
Was the coffin borne away!</p>

<p>See—about the nursery floor<br>
All her little heritage:<br>
Rubber ball and battledore,<br>
Tattered book and coloured page.</p>

<p>Poor forsaken doll! in vain<br>
Stretch your arms. She will not come.<br>
Stopped forever is the train,<br>
And the music-box is dumb.</p>

<p>Some one touched it soft, apart,<br>
Where the silence is her name.<br>
And what sinking of the heart<br>
At the plaintive note that came!</p>

<p>Ah, the anguish! when the tomb<br>
Robs the cradle; when bereft<br>
We discover in the gloom<br>
Child toys that an angel left.</p><a name="45"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AFTER WRITING MY DRAMATIC REVIEW</p>

<p>My columns are ranged and steady,<br>
Upbearing, though sad forespent,<br>
The newspaper pediment,<br>
And my review is ready.</p>

<p>Now for a week, poetaster,<br>
My door is bolted. Away,<br>
Thou still-born masterpiece,—aye,<br>
Till Monday I am my master.</p>

<p>No melodrama shall whiten<br>
My labour with threadbare leaves.<br>
The warp that my fancy weaves<br>
With silken flowers shall brighten.</p>

<p>Brief moment my spirit's warder,<br>
Ye voices of soul that float,<br>
I'll hearken your sorrow's note,<br>
Nor verses evoke to order.</p>

<p>Then deep in my glass regaining<br>
The health of a day gone by,—<br>
Old visions for company—<br>
The bloom of my vintage draining,</p>

<p>The wine of my thought I'll measure,<br>
Wine virgin of alien glow,<br>
Grapes trodden by life, that flow<br>
From my heart at my heart's own pleasure!</p><a name="46"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE CASTLE OF REMEMBRANCE</p>

<p>Before my hearth with head low-bowed<br>
I dream, and strive to reach again,<br>
Across the misty past's gray cloud,<br>
Unto Remembrance's domain,</p>

<p>Where tree and house and upland way<br>
Are blurred and blue like passing ghosts,<br>
And the eye, ponder though it may,<br>
Consults in vain the guiding-posts.</p>

<p>Now gropingly to gain a sight<br>
Of all the buried world, I press<br>
Through mystic marge of shade and light<br>
And limbo of forgetfulness.</p>

<p>But white, diaphanous Memory stands,<br>
Where many roadways meet and spread,<br>
Like Ariadne, in my hands<br>
Thrusting her little ball of thread.</p>

<p>Henceforth the way is all secure.<br>
The shrouded sun hath reappeared,<br>
And o'er the trees with vision sure<br>
I see the castle tower upreared.</p>

<p>Beneath the boughs where day grows dark<br>
With shower on shower of leaves down-poured<br>
The dear old path through moss and bark<br>
Still lengthens far its narrow cord.</p>

<p>But creeping-plant and bramble-spray<br>
Have wrought a net to daunt me now.<br>
The stubborn branch I force away<br>
Swings fiercely back to lash my brow.</p>

<p>I come upon the house at last.<br>
No window lit with lamp or face,<br>
No breath of smoke from gables vast,<br>
To touch with life the mouldering place!</p>

<p>Bridges are crumbling. Moats are still,<br>
And slimed with rank, green refuse-flowers,<br>
And tortuous waves of ivy fill<br>
The crevices and choke the towers.</p>

<p>The portico in moonlight wanes.<br>
Time sculptures it to suit his whim.<br>
And with the wash of many rains<br>
My coloured coat of arms is dim.</p>

<p>The door I open eagerly.<br>
The ancient hinges creak and halt.<br>
A breath of dampness wafts to me<br>
The musty odour of the vault.</p>

<p>The hairy nettle sharp of sting,<br>
The coarse and broad-leafed burdock weed<br>
In court-yard nooks are prospering,<br>
By spreading hemlocks canopied.</p>

<p>Upon two marble monsters near,<br>
That guard the mossy steps of stone,<br>
The shadow of a tree falls clear,<br>
That in my absence has upgrown.</p>

<p>Sudden the lion sentinels raise<br>
Their paws, aggressive and malign,<br>
And challenge me with their white gaze;<br>
But soft I breathe the countersign.</p>

<p>I pass. The old dog menaceth,<br>
But falls back hushed, the shades amid.<br>
My resonant footstep wakeneth<br>
Crouched echoes in their corners hid.</p>

<p>Through yellow panes of glass a ray<br>
Of dubious light creeps down the hall<br>
Where ancient tapestries display<br>
Apollo's fortunes from the wall.</p>

<p>Fair tree-bound Daphne still with grace<br>
Stretches her tufted fingers green.<br>
But in the amorous god's embrace<br>
She fades, a formless phantom seen.</p>

<p>I watch divine Apollo stand,<br>
Herdsman to acarus-riddled sheep,<br>
The Muses Nine, a haggard band,<br>
Upon a faded Pindus weep;</p>

<p>While Solitude in scanty gown<br>
Traces &quot;Desertion&quot; in the dust<br>
That through the air she sifteth down<br>
Upon a marble stand august.</p>

<p>And now, among forgotten things,<br>
I find, like sleepers manifold,<br>
Pastels bedimmed, dark picturings,<br>
Young beauties, and the friends of old.</p>

<p>My faltering fingers lift a crape,—<br>
And lo, my love with look and lure!<br>
With puffing skirts and prisoned shape!<br>
Cidalise <i><font face="Times New Roman">à</font> la</i> Pompadour!</p>

<p>A tender, blossoming rose she feels<br>
Against her ribboned bodice pressed,<br>
Whose lace half hides and half reveals<br>
A snowy, azure-vein<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d breast.</p>

<p>Within her eyes gleam sparkles lush,<br>
As on the rime-kissed, deadened leaves.<br>
Upon her cheek a purple flush—<br>
Death's own cosmetic hue!—deceives.</p>

<p>She startles as I come before,<br>
And fixeth soft on me her eyes,<br>
Reproachfully forevermore,<br>
Yet with a charm and witching wise.</p>

<p>Life bore me from thee at its will,<br>
Yet on my heart thy name is laid,<br>
Thou dead delight, that lingereth still,<br>
Bedizened for the masquerade!</p>

<p>Envious of Art, fair Nature wrought<br>
To overpass Murillo's fame,—<br>
From Andalusia here she brought<br>
The face that lights the second frame.</p>

<p>By some poetical caprice,<br>
Our atmosphere of mist and cloud,<br>
With rare exotic charm's increase<br>
This other Petra Camara dowed.</p>

<p>Warm orange tones are gilding yet<br>
Her lovely skin of roseate hue.<br>
Her eyelids fair have lashes jet<br>
That beams of sunshine filter through.</p>

<p>There shimmers fine a pearly gleam<br>
Between her scarlet lips elate;<br>
Her beauty flashes forth supreme—<br>
A bright south summer pomegranate.</p>

<p>Long to the sound of Spain's guitar,<br>
I told her praise 'mid song and glass.<br>
She came alone one evenstar,<br>
And all my room Alhambra was.</p>

<p>Farther I see a robust Fair,<br>
With strong and gem-beladen arms.<br>
In pearls of price and velvet rare<br>
Are set her ivory bosom's charms.</p>

<p>Her ennui is a weary queen's,<br>
An adulating court amid.<br>
Superb, aloof, her hand she leans<br>
Upon a casket's jewelled lid.</p>

<p>Her sensuous lips their crimes confess,<br>
As crimson with the blood of hearts.<br>
With brutal, mad voluptuousness<br>
Her conquering eye a challenge darts.</p>

<p>Here dwells, in lieu of tender grace,<br>
Vertiginous allure, whereof<br>
A cruel Venus ruled a race,<br>
Presiding o'er malignant love.</p>

<p>Unnatural mother to her child,<br>
This Venus all imperative!<br>
O thou, my bitter joy and wild,—<br>
Farewell forever! I forgive!</p>

<p>Within its frame in shadow fine,<br>
The misty glass that still endures<br>
Reveals another face than mine,—<br>
The earliest of my portraitures.</p>

<p>A retrospective ghost, with face<br>
Of vanished type, steps from the vast<br>
Dim mirror of his biding-place<br>
In tenebrous, forgotten past.</p>

<p>Gay in his doublet satin-rose,<br>
Coloured in bold and vivid way,<br>
He seems as if about to pose<br>
For Deveria or Boulanger.</p>

<p>Terror of glabrous commoner,<br>
His flowing locks in royal guise,<br>
Like mane of lion, or sinister<br>
King's hair, fall heavy to his thighs.</p>

<p>Romanticist of bold conceit,<br>
Knight of an art which strives anew,<br>
He hurled himself at Drama's feet,<br>
When erst Hernani's trumpet blew.</p>

<p>Night falls. The corners are astir<br>
With many shapes and shadows tall.<br>
The Unknown—grim stage-carpenter—<br>
Sets up its darksome frights o'er all.</p>

<p>A sudden burst of candles, weird<br>
With aureoles, like lamps of death!<br>
The room is populous, and bleared<br>
With folk brought hither by a breath!</p>

<p>Down step the portraits from the wall,—<br>
A ruddy-litten company!<br>
Circling the fireplace in the hall,<br>
Where the wood blazes suddenly.</p>

<p>The figures wrested from the tombs<br>
Have lost their rigid, frozen mien,<br>
The gradual glow of life illumes<br>
The Past with flush incarnadine.</p>

<p>A colour lights the faces pale,<br>
As in the days of old delight.<br>
Friends whom my thought shall never fail,<br>
I thank ye, that ye came to-night!</p>

<p>Now eighteen-thirty shows to me<br>
Its great and valiant-hearted men.<br>
(Ah, like Otranto's pirates, we<br>
Who were an hundred, are but ten!)</p>

<p>And one his reddish beard spreads out,<br>
Like Barbarossa in his cave.<br>
Another his mustachio stout<br>
Curls at the ends in fashion suave.</p>

<p>Under the ample fold that cloaks<br>
An ever unreveal<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d ill,<br>
Petrus a cigarette now smokes,<br>
Naming it &quot;papelito&quot; still.</p>

<p>Another cometh, fain to tell<br>
His visions and his hopes supreme.<br>
Like Icarus on the sands he fell,<br>
Where lie all broken shafts of dream.</p>

<p>And one a drama hath begot,<br>
Planned after some new model's freak,<br>
Which, merging all things in its plot,<br>
Makes Calderon with Moli<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>re speak.</p>

<p>Tom, late forsaken by his Dear,<br>
Love's Labour's Lost must low recite;<br>
And Fritz to Cidalise makes clear<br>
Faust's vision of Walpurgis Night.</p>

<p>But dawn comes through the window free.<br>
Diaphanous the phantoms grow.<br>
The objects of reality<br>
Strike through their shapes that merge and go.</p>

<p>The candles are consumed away.<br>
The ember-lights no longer gleam<br>
Upon the hearth. No thing shall stay.<br>
Farewell, O castle of my dream!</p>

<p>December gray shall turn once more<br>
The glass of Time, for all we fret!<br>
The present enters at my door,<br>
And vainly bids me to forget.</p><a name="47"></a><br>

<p>CAMELLIA AND MEADOW-DAISY</p>

<p>We praise the hot-house flowers that loom<br>
Far from their native sun and shade,<br>

Like jewels under glass displayed.</p>

<p>With never breeze to kiss their heads,<br>
They have their birth and live and die<br>
On costly, artificial beds,<br>
Beneath an ever-crystal sky.</p>

<p>For whomsoever idly scans,<br>
Baring their treasures to entice,<br>
Like fair and sumptuous courtesans,<br>
They stand for sale at golden price.</p>

<p>Fine porcelain holds their gathered groups,<br>
Or glove-clad fingers fondle them<br>
Between the dances, till each droops<br>
Upon a limp or broken stem.</p>

<p>But down amid the grass unreaped,<br>
Shunning the curious, in repose<br>
And silence all the long day steeped,<br>
A little woodland daisy blows.</p>

<p>A butterfly upon the wing<br>
To point the place, a casual look,<br>
And you surprise the sweet, shy thing,<br>
Within its calm, sequestered nook.</p>

<p>Beneath the blue it openeth,<br>
Rising on slender, vernal rod,<br>
Spreading its soul in fragrant breath<br>
For solitude and for its God.</p>

<p>And proud camellias tall and white,<br>
Red tulips in a flaming mass,<br>
Are all at once forgotten quite,<br>
For the small flower amid the grass.</p><a name="48"></a><br>

<p>THE FELLAH</p>

<p><i>On seeing a Water-Colour by Princess Mathilde</i></p>

<p>Caprice of brush fantastical,<br>
And of imperial idleness,<br>
Your fellah-sphinx presents us all<br>
With an enigma worth the guess.</p>

<p>A rigid fashion, verily,<br>
This mask, this garment, seem to us,<br>
Intriguing with its mystery<br>
The ball-room's every Oedipus.</p>

<p>Isis bequeathed her veil of old<br>
To modern daughters of the Nile.<br>
But through this band austere, behold,<br>
Two stars of radiance beam and smile,—</p>

<p>Two stars, two eyes, two poems that spring,<br>
The soft, voluptuous fires whereof<br>
Resolve the riddle, murmuring:<br>
&quot;Lo, I am Beauty! Be thou Love!&quot;</p><a name="49"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE GARRET</p>

<p>From balcony tiles where casual cats<br>
Sit low in wait for birds unwise,<br>
I see the worn and riven slats<br>
Of a poor, humble garret rise.</p>

<p>Now could I as an author lie,<br>
To give you comfort as you think,<br>
Its window I would falsify,<br>
And frame with flowers refined and pink,</p>

<p>And place within it Rigolette<br>
With her cheap looking-glass, somehow,<br>
Whose broken glazing mirrors yet<br>
A portion of her pretty brow;</p>

<p>Or Margery, her dress undone,<br>
Her hair blown free, her tie forgot,<br>
Watering in the pleasant sun<br>
Her pail-encompassed garden-plot;</p>

<p>Or poet-youth whom fame awaits,<br>
Who scans his verse and eyes the hills,<br>
Or in a reverie contemplates<br>
Montmartre with its distant mills.</p>

<p>Alas! my garret is no feint.<br>
There climbeth no convolvulus.<br>
The window with its nibbled paint<br>
Leers filmy and unluminous.</p>

<p>Alike for artist and grisette,<br>
Alike for widower and lad,<br>
A garret—save to music set—<br>
Is never otherwise than sad.</p>

<p>Of old, beneath an angle pent,<br>
That forced the forehead to a kiss,<br>
Love, with a folding-couch content,<br>
To chat with Susan deemed it bliss.</p>

<p>But we must wad our bliss about<br>
With cushioned walls and laces wide,<br>
And silks that flutter in and out,<br>
O'er beds by Monbro canopied.</p>

<p>This evening, to Mount Breda fled<br>
Is Rigolette, to linger there,<br>
And Margery, well clothed and fed,<br>
No longer tends her garden fair.</p>

<p>The poet, tired of catching rimes<br>
Upon the wing, has turned to cull<br>
Reporter's bays, and left betimes<br>
A heaven for an entresol.</p>

<p>And in the window this is all:<br>
An ancient goody chattering,<br>
And railing at a kitten small<br>
That toys forever with a string.</p><a name="50"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE CLOUD</p>

<p>Lightly in the azure air<br>
Soars a cloud, emerging free<br>
Like a virgin from the fair<br>
Blue sea;</p>

<p>Or an Aphrodite sweet,<br>
Floating upright and empearled<br>
In the shell, about its feet<br>
Foam-curled.</p>

<p>Undulating overhead,<br>
How its changing body glows!<br>
On its shoulder dawn hath spread<br>
A rose.</p>

<p>Marble, snow, blend amorously<br>
In that form by sunlight kissed—<br>
Slumbering Antiope<br>
Of mist!</p>

<p>Sailing unto distant goal,<br>
Over Alps and Apennines,<br>
Sister of the woman-soul,<br>
It shines;</p>

<p>Till my heart flies forth at last<br>
On the wings of passion warm,<br>
And I yearn to gather fast<br>
Its form.</p>

<p>Reason saith: &quot;Mere vapour thing!<br>
Bursting bubble! Yet, we deem,<br>
Holds this wind-distorted ring<br>
Our dream.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith declareth: &quot;Beauty seen,<br>
Like a cloud, is but a thought,<br>
Or a breath, that, having been,<br>
Is naught.</p>

<p>&quot;Have thy vision. Build it proud.<br>
Let thy soul be full thereof.<br>
Love a woman—love a cloud—<br>
But love!&quot;</p><a name="51"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE BLACKBIRD</p>

<p>A bird from yonder branch at dawn<br>
Is trilling forth a joyful note,<br>
Or hopping o'er the frozen lawn,<br>
In yellow boots and ebon coat.</p>

<p>It is the blackbird credulous.<br>
Little of calendar knows he,<br>
Whose soul, with sunbeams luminous,<br>
Sings April to the snows that be.</p>

<p>Rain sweeps in torrents unrepressed.<br>
The Arve makes dull the Rhone with mire.<br>
The pleasant hall retains its guest<br>
In goodly cheer before the fire.</p>

<p>The mountains have their ermine on,<br>
Each one a mighty magistrate,<br>
And hold grave conference upon<br>
A case of Winter lasting late.</p>

<p>The bird dries well his wing, and long,<br>
Despite the rains, the mists that roll,<br>
Insists upon his little song,<br>
Believes in Spring with all his soul.</p>

<p>He softly chides the slumberous morn<br>
For dallying so long abed,<br>
And bids the shivering flower forlorn<br>
Be bold, and raise aloft its head;</p>

<p>Behind the dark sees day that smiles,<br>
Even as behind the Holy Rod,<br>
When bare the altar, dim the aisles,<br>
The child of faith beholds his God.</p>

<p>He trusts to Nature's purpose high,<br>
Sure of her laws for here and now.<br>
Who laughs at thy philosophy,<br>
Dear blackbird, is less wise than thou!</p><a name="52"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE FLOWER THAT MAKES THE SPRINGTIME</p>

<p>The chestnut trees are soon to flower<br>
At fair <i>Saint Jean,</i> the villa dipped<br>
In sun, before whose viny tower<br>
Stretch purple mountains silver-tipped.</p>

<p>The little leaves that yesterday<br>
Pressed in their bodices were seen<br>
Have put their sober garb away,<br>
And touched the tender twigs with green.</p>

<p>But vainly do the sunbeams fill<br>
The branches with a flood of light.<br>
The shy bud hesitateth still<br>
To show the secret thyrse of white.</p>

<p>And yet the rosy peach-tree blooms,<br>
Like some faint blush of first desire.<br>
The apple waves a wealth of plumes,<br>
And laughs in all its fresh attire.</p>

<p>To bask amid the buttercups<br>
The timid speedwell ventures out.<br>
Nature calls every earthling up,<br>
And reassures each tiny sprout.</p>

<p>Yet I must off to other sphere!<br>
Then please your poet, chestnuts tall,<br>
Yea, spread ye forth without a fear<br>
Your firework bloom fantastical!</p>

<p>I know your summer splendour's pride.<br>
I've seen you standing sumptuous<br>
In autumn's tunics purple-dyed,<br>
With golden circlets luminous.</p>

<p>In winter white and crystal-crossed<br>
Your delicate boughs I saw again,—<br>
Like lovely traceries the frost<br>
Limns lightly on the window-pane.</p>

<p>Your every garment I have known,<br>
Ye chestnuts grand that loom aloft,—<br>
Save one to me you've never shown,<br>
Of young green fabric first and soft.</p>

<p>Ah, well, good-bye, for I must go!<br>
Keep, then, your flowers, where'er they be.<br>
There is another flower I know,<br>
That makes the springtime fair for me.</p>

<p>Let May with all her blooms arise,<br>
Let May with all her blooms depart!<br>
That flower sufficeth for mine eyes,<br>
And hath pure honey in its heart.</p>

<p>Let be the season where it waits,<br>
And blue or dull be heaven's dome—<br>
It smiles and charms and captivates,—<br>
The precious violet of my home!</p><a name="53"></a><br>
<br>

<p>A LAST WISH</p>

<p>How long my soul has loved thee, love!<br>
It is full many a year agone.<br>
Thy spring—what charm of flowers thereof,<br>
My winter—what wild snows thereon!</p>

<p>White lilacs from the land of graves<br>
Blow near my temples. Soon enow<br>
Thou'lt mark the pallid mass that waves<br>
Enshadowing my withered brow.</p>

<p>My westering sun must speedy drop,<br>
And disappear behind the road.<br>
Already on the dim hill-top,<br>
There gleams and waits my last abode.</p>

<p>Then from thy rosy lips let fall<br>
Upon my lips a tardy kiss,<br>
That in my tomb, when comes the call,<br>
My heart may rest, remembering this.</p><a name="54"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE DOVE</p>

<p>O tender, beauteous dove,<br>
Calling such plaintive things!<br>
Wilt serve unto my love,<br>
And be my love's own wings?</p>

<p>O, but we 're like, poor heart!<br>
Thy dear one, too, is far.<br>
Remembering, apart,<br>
Each weeps beneath the star.</p>

<p>Let not thy rosy feet<br>
Stay once on any tower,—<br>
I am so fain, my sweet,—<br>
So weary turns the hour!</p>

<p>Forswear the palm's repose<br>
That spreadeth over all,<br>
And gables where the snows<br>
Of other pinions fall.</p>

<p>Now fail me not, nor fear!<br>
He dwelleth near the king.<br>
Give him this letter, dear,<br>
These kisses on thy wing.</p>

<p>Then seek again my breast,<br>
This flaming, throbbing goal,<br>
Then come, my dove, and rest—<br>
But bring me back his soul!</p><a name="55"></a><br>
<br>

<p>A PLEASANT EVENING</p>

<p>What flurrying of rains and snows!<br>
Now every coachman, blue of nose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fur and ire<br>
Sits petrified. Oh, it were right<br>
To spend this wild December night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before one's fire!</p>

<p>The cosy chimney-corner chair<br>
Assumes its most persuasive air.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seem to see<br>
Its arms held out, its voice to hear,<br>
Beseeching like a mistress dear:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah, stay with me!&quot;</p>

<p>A gauze reveals the orb<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>d lamp,<br>
Like a fair breast beneath a guimpe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drowsily<br>
The shimmer of its light ascends,<br>
Flushing with gold and crimson blends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ceiling high.</p>

<p>The silence frames no sound of things,<br>
Save for the pendulum that swings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its golden disk,<br>
And many winds that roam and weep,<br>
Or stealthy to the hall-way sweep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To dance and frisk.</p>

<p>It's ball-night at the Embassy.<br>
My coat's limp sleeves are signalling me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To dress anon.<br>
My waistcoat yawns. My shirt obtuse<br>
Seems raising high its wristbands loose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be put on.</p>

<p>A narrow boot's abundant glaze<br>
Reflects the ruddy firelight's blaze.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I forgot?<br>
A glove's flat fingers span the shelf.<br>
A thin cravat protrudes itself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And begs a knot.</p>

<p>Then must I forth? But what a bore—<br>
To seek the over-crowded door!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fall in line<br>
Of coaches bearing coats of arms<br>
And haughty beauties with their charms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superb and fine!</p>

<p>To stand against a portal wide<br>
And see the surging mass inside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear form on form:<br>
Old faces, faces fresh and young,<br>
Black coats low bodices among,—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A motley swarm!</p>

<p>And puffy backs that hide their red<br>
With laces fine of costly thread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aerial,<br>
Dandies, diplomatists, that press,<br>
With features dull, expressionless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At fashion's call.</p>

<p>What! Brave, to win a glance of hers,<br>
The rows of lynx-eyed dowagers!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try undeterred<br>
To speak the dear name of my dear,<br>
And whisper softly in her ear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love's little word!</p>

<p>Nay, but I'll not! Her eye shall heed<br>
A letter in the flowers I'll speed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No ball-room now!<br>
Let Parma violets make good<br>
Whatever be her passing mood.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hold my vow.</p>

<p>Ensconced with Heine or with Taine,<br>
Or, if I like, the Goncourts twain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time will go.<br>
I'll dream, until the hour shall stir<br>
Reality, and wait for her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll come, I know.</p><a name="56"></a><br>
<br>

<p>ART</p>

<p>More fair the work, more strong,<br>
Stamped in resistance long,—<br>
Enamel, marble, song.</p>

<p>Poet, no shackles bear,<br>
Yet bid thy Muse to wear<br>
The buskin bound with care.</p>

<p>A fashion loose forsake,—<br>
A shoe of sloven make,<br>
That any foot may take.</p>

<p>Sculptor, the clay withstand,<br>
That yieldeth to the hand,<br>
Though listless heart command.</p>

<p>Contend till thou have wrought,<br>
Till the hard stone have caught<br>
The beauty of thy thought.</p>

<p>With Paros match thy might,<br>
And with Carrara bright,<br>
That guard the line of light.</p>

<p>Borrow from Syracuse<br>
The bronze's stubborn use,<br>
Wherein thy form to choose.</p>

<p>And with a delicate grace<br>
In the veined onyx trace<br>
Apollo's perfect face.</p>

<p>Painter, put thou aside<br>
The transient. Be thy pride<br>
The colour furnace-tried.</p>

<p>Limn thou, fantastic, free<br>
Blue sirens of the sea,<br>
And beasts of heraldry.</p>

<p>Before a nimbus gold<br>
Transcendently uphold<br>
The Child, the Cross foretold.</p>

<p>Things perish. Gods have passed.<br>
But song sublimely cast<br>
Shall citadels outlast.</p>

<p>And the forgotten seal<br>
Turned by the plowman's steel<br>
An emperor may reveal.</p>

<p>For Art alone is great:<br>
The bust survives the state,<br>
The crown the potentate.</p>

<p>Carve, burnish, build thy theme,—<br>
But fix thy wavering dream<br>
In the stern rock supreme.</p>---
